### Zorro
This is Zorro, the implementation of a distributed threadpool with work stealing enabled. It builds on Linux OS and use C++17 as the programming language.

It aims to separate parallel task definition and execution. This should ease users' experience of executing multiple tasks in parallel by automatically managing the scheduling and work balancing while squeezing all the parallel performance out of the underlying hardware.

#### Key Challenge

Firstly, load balancing is hard. Without knowing the exact workload of each task, the workload balancing has to been dynamically on the fly. This is why we need the work-stealing policy.

Secondly, with a distributed work queue, synchronization is challenging. The more workers in the threadpool, the higher the contention for critical data structure.

#### Preliminary Result

| Thread = 8               | Dummy | Global Queue |
|--------------------------|-------|--------------|
| Correctness              | 0     | 501 (**0.000**)  |
| Light                    | 1     | 473 (**0.002**)  |
| Computation              | 5260  | 686 (**7.668**)  |
| Imbalanced               | 2187  | 328 (**6.668**)  |
| Recursion (Divide)       | 106   | 27  (**3.926**)  |
| Recursion (Divide+Merge) | 1269  | 888 (**1.429**)  |
